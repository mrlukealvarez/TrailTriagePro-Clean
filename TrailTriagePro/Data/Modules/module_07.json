Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that allows glucose to enter cells. Glucose gives our cells energy. When there isn't enough insulin or cells are resistant to insulin, higher blood glucose levels (BGL) circulate through the bloodstream. Over time, higher BGLs have long-term consequences such as heart and kidney disease, neuropathy, and vision loss. Some people control their diabetes with oral medications and some require insulin medication which is injected below the skin.", "orderIndex": 4},

Normal ranges are 70-110 mg/dl or 3.9 – 6.1 mmol/l. However, every person is different, each with unique BGL thresholds that work for them.", "orderIndex": 6},

Severe hypoglycemia (BGLs below 50 mg/dl or 3.0 mmol/l) is considered a true medical emergency and requires prompt action. Hypoglycemia is on a spectrum that ranges from mild symptoms to unresponsiveness. Some participants may have a medication called glucagon which helps mobilize glucose stores in the liver for cells to use.", "orderIndex": 7},

Blood glucose levels can creep up over a period of hours to days. If left untreated, hyperglycemia can become severe, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with BGLs above 400 mg/d or significantly higher than a person's normal upper range. DKA occurs when cells have to use fats and proteins for energy because they cannot access sugar in the bloodstream. This leaves ketones as a byproduct in the blood stream, which causes severe illness by dropping the pH of the blood. DKA causes dehydration; if someone can tolerate fluids without vomiting get them to drink unsweetened fluids.", "orderIndex": 8},
