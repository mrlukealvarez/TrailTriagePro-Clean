# TrailTriage: WFR Toolkit v1.0.0
## Released: November 13, 2025

### 🦝 Jimmothy's Welcome
"Hey wilderness responders! Jimmothy here, and I'm SO excited to introduce TrailTriage: WFR Toolkit! After months of testing (many nights in the backcountry), we're ready to help you document patient care like a pro. Let's make every SOAP note count!"

---

### ✨ New Features
- **SOAP Note Templates** - Create professional documentation with guided templates
  - Jimmothy's Note: No more forgetting important details! The app walks you through Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections.
- **Vital Signs Tracking** - Monitor patient vitals with timestamps and trending
  - Jimmothy's Note: Perfect for those long evacuations when you need to track changes over time
- **GPS Location Capture** - Automatically record incident coordinates
  - Jimmothy's Note: Essential for SAR operations! No more trying to remember "which ridge was it?"
- **PDF Export** - Generate professional reports for EMS handoff
  - Jimmothy's Note: AirDrop straight to the ambulance crew. They'll love you for it.
- **Offline Protocol Library** - 80+ hours of wilderness medicine protocols
  - Jimmothy's Note: Cell service? Never heard of her. Access everything offline.
- **iCloud Sync** - Keep notes backed up and synced across devices
  - Jimmothy's Note: Because losing your documentation would be a HIPAA nightmare

### 🔧 Improvements
- Optimized for backcountry conditions (low battery, poor GPS, no connectivity)
- Clean, intuitive interface designed for gloved hands
- Dark mode support for night operations
- Jimmothy noticed: The app works great even at high altitude!

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Initial release - all systems are Jimmothy-approved! ✅

### 🦝 Jimmothy's Pro Tip
"Start your SOAP note the moment you make patient contact. Document as you go, not when you get back to camp. Future you (and the ER doc) will thank you! And remember: if you didn't document it, it didn't happen."
