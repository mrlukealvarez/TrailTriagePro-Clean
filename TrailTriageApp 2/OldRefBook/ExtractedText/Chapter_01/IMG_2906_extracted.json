  "text": "ABOUT\nDESERT MOUNTAIN MEDICINE\nTEACHING\nPHILOSOPHY\nesert Mountain Medicine was started with the premise that wilderness\nmedicine instruction should not be limited to classroom lectures. We are\ndriven to develop a creative, experiential based curriculum; one which effectively\naddresses the dynamic nature of a wilderness environment and the rapid\nadvancement in emergency care, as well as supports and addresses multiple\nlearning styles. Our teaching\ng approach heavily favors hands-on, scenario-based\npractice taught in an outdoor setting while simulating real-world examples. The\ncompletion of scenarios plays\ns a powerful role in self-reflection and allows for\ninquiry-based learning so each student can relate his or her experience to the\nreal world. We believe students should be physically involved in the learning\nprocess so that intensive learning outcomes are experienced as challenging, fun,\nand applicable to all aspects of life. We know that our teaching philosophy is\nsuccessful when students have mastered the material, attained personal growth,\nand expanded awareness of self, others, and environment.\nW\ne believe that practice and repetition of increasingly complex scenarios\nhelps students develop an in-depth and personalized approach to\npatient assessment where the learning is ingrained and can be accessed and\napplied rapidly in an emergency situation. Our teaching approach develops the\nstudents' abilities to immediately retrieve and utilize the skills needed to treat\nindividuals in the event of a real wilderness emergency. Our teaching focuses on\ndeveloping high levels of expertise, teamwork, and leadership while stimulating\ncommunication, facilitating critical-thinking, and refining students' decision-\nmaking skills.\nesert Mountain Medicine instructors pride themselves on the dynamic\ndelivery of course curricula using innovative educational techniques and\nnat are rich in quality,\nintegrative scenarios. We strive to deliver course\nconsistency, and effectiveness in an energizing and engaging classroom\nenvironment. We take the responsibility of teaching very seriously.",
